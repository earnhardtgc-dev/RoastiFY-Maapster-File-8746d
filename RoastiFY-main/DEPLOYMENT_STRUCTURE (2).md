# 📁 EXACT FILE DEPLOYMENT STRUCTURE 📁

## FOR NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT (RECOMMENDED)

### What to Upload:
Put ALL files in the SAME FOLDER (root directory). Here's the exact structure:

```
ai-roast-master/           ← Create this folder
├── index.html            ← MAIN APP FILE (REQUIRED)
├── package.json          ← Dependencies (for backend features)
├── server.js             ← Backend server (for payments)
├── netlify.toml          ← Netlify configuration
├── .env.example          ← Environment variables template
├── vercel.json           ← Alternative deployment config
├── viral_app_concept.md  ← Documentation (optional)
├── LAUNCH_GUIDE.md       ← Instructions (optional)
├── SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEMPLATES.md ← Marketing guide (optional)
└── MONETIZATION_GUIDE.md ← Revenue guide (optional)
```

### CRITICAL: Files You MUST Upload for App to Work:
1. **index.html** - This is your entire app (MOST IMPORTANT)
2. **netlify.toml** - Tells Netlify how to deploy
3. **package.json** - Required for backend features

### Files You Can Skip for Basic Deployment:
- All .md files (these are just guides)
- server.js (only needed for advanced payment features)
- .env.example (only needed when adding payments)

## STEP-BY-STEP NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (EASIEST)
1. **Download ALL files** from your workspace to your computer
2. **Create a folder** called "ai-roast-master" 
3. **Put ALL files** in that folder (same level, no subfolders)
4. **Go to netlify.com** and sign up
5. **Drag the entire folder** onto the deploy area
6. **DONE!** Your app is live

### Method 2: GitHub (More Professional)
1. **Create GitHub repository** called "ai-roast-master"
2. **Upload all files** to the repository root
3. **Connect Netlify** to your GitHub repo
4. **Auto-deploy** on every change

## FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT

### File Structure (Same as Netlify):
```
your-app-folder/
├── index.html     ← Main app
├── vercel.json    ← Vercel config  
├── package.json   ← Dependencies
└── server.js      ← Backend (optional)
```

### Steps:
1. **Upload files** to Vercel dashboard
2. **Choose "Static Site"** option
3. **Deploy automatically**

## FOR GITHUB PAGES (Free Alternative)

### Repository Structure:
```
your-repo/
├── index.html     ← MUST be in root for GitHub Pages
├── (other files)  ← Can be anywhere
```

### Steps:
1. **Create GitHub repository**
2. **Upload index.html** to root
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
4. **Choose "Deploy from root"**

## WHAT EACH FILE DOES

### REQUIRED FILES:
- **index.html**: Complete app (frontend + basic functionality)
- **package.json**: Tells hosting service what dependencies to install
- **netlify.toml**: Configuration for optimal Netlify deployment

### BACKEND FILES (Optional for basic version):
- **server.js**: Handles payments and advanced AI features
- **.env.example**: Template for API keys and secrets

### DOCUMENTATION (Reference only):
- **viral_app_concept.md**: Business plan and strategy
- **LAUNCH_GUIDE.md**: Marketing and launch instructions  
- **SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEMPLATES.md**: Viral content templates
- **MONETIZATION_GUIDE.md**: Revenue optimization guide

## QUICK DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### ✅ For Basic App (No Payments):
- [ ] Download index.html
- [ ] Upload to Netlify/Vercel
- [ ] Share live URL
- [ ] Start getting viral traffic

### ✅ For Full App (With Payments):
- [ ] Download ALL files
- [ ] Set up Stripe account
- [ ] Add API keys to environment
- [ ] Deploy complete package
- [ ] Start making money

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If App Doesn't Load:
1. **Check index.html** is in root directory
2. **Verify file names** are exact (case-sensitive)
3. **Test locally** by opening index.html in browser

### If Payments Don't Work:
1. **Add your Stripe keys** to environment variables
2. **Enable backend** by deploying server.js
3. **Update API endpoints** in index.html

### If Images/Styles Break:
1. **All files** must be in same folder
2. **Check relative paths** in HTML
3. **Verify upload** completed successfully

Remember: **index.html contains the ENTIRE working app**. Everything else is just enhancement and documentation!

## 🚀 FASTEST PATH TO LIVE APP:

1. Download **index.html** only
2. Upload to **netlify.com** 
3. Get live URL
4. Start sharing and going viral
5. Add payments later when you see traction

**Your app will work 100% with just index.html!**
