## üìù **DETAILED SCRIPT**

### **SCENE 1: THE SETUP** *(0:00 - 0:30)*

**FADE IN: Modern podcast studio setup**

**TONY**: *(holding phone)* So there's this new app called RoastiFY that supposedly roasts people better than we do.

**JOE**: *(leaning back)* AI roasting humans? That's like... what if the machines are already taking over and we just think it's comedy?

**SHANE**: *(grabbing phone)* Let me see this thing. *(scrolls through app)* Oh shit, it has different styles? Professional, savage, friendly... 

**TONY**: There's no way AI can match the precision of a crafted roast.

**SHANE**: I bet I can break this thing. Watch this...

---

### **SCENE 2: SHANE'S SCHEME** *(0:30 - 1:30)*

**SHANE**: *(typing on phone)* Okay, instead of roasting someone, I'm gonna see if it can write a love letter.

**TONY**: That's not what it's for, Shane.

**SHANE**: *(still typing)* "Write a professional letter to Notre Dame's head coach requesting a Bud Light kegerator on the sideline using the athletics refreshment budget."

**JOE**: *(laughing)* You're trying to get free beer at football games through an AI roast app?

**SHANE**: *(hits generate)* This better work or I'm driving to South Bend myself.

**[APP VOICE/TEXT OVERLAY]**: *"Dear Coach Freeman, I am writing to propose a revolutionary sideline refreshment initiative that will elevate Notre Dame football to unprecedented levels of hydration and team morale..."*

**SHANE**: *(reading)* Holy shit, it's actually professional! *(continues reading)* "The strategic placement of a Bud Light kegerator would provide optimal electrolyte replacement while honoring Notre Dame's commitment to excellence and tradition..."

**TONY**: It sounds like a real proposal!

**SHANE**: I'm sending this. *(pretends to email)* If this works, I'm never buying beer again.

---

### **SCENE 3: TONY'S PERFECTIONISM** *(1:30 - 2:30)*

**TONY**: Alright, let me show you how this should actually work. *(takes phone)* I'm gonna roast Joe.

**JOE**: Oh great, here we go.

**TONY**: *(typing)* "Joe Rogan, podcast host, obsessed with DMT and bow hunting."

**[APP GENERATES ROAST]**: *"Joe, you've talked about DMT so much that even the aliens are tired of hearing from you. And your bow hunting stories? Even the deer are rolling their eyes."*

**TONY**: *(critiquing)* Okay, that's not bad structure, but the punchline could be tighter. *(talking to phone)* You see, the key to a good roast is the rhythm. You build tension, then release with precision.

**JOE**: Are you coaching an AI?

**TONY**: *(still focused on phone)* The setup was decent, but it needed more specificity. Like mention the fact that he's probably high right now.

**SHANE**: Tony, you're literally arguing with a robot.

**TONY**: *(defensive)* I'm providing constructive feedback!

---

### **SCENE 4: JOE'S PHILOSOPHY** *(2:30 - 3:30)*

**JOE**: Let me try this. *(takes phone)* This is actually fascinating when you think about it.

**SHANE**: Here it comes...

**JOE**: *(typing)* I'm gonna roast myself. "Joe Rogan, podcaster who questions everything."

**[APP GENERATES]**: *"Joe, you question everything except why you're still surprised when people think you're high during interviews."*

**JOE**: *(genuinely impressed)* Dude, that's... that's actually insightful. This AI understood my psychology.

**TONY**: It's a roast app, Joe, not therapy.

**JOE**: But think about it - artificial intelligence analyzing human behavior patterns to create comedy. That's like... what if comedy is just pattern recognition? What if laughter is how our brains process incongruity?

**SHANE**: *(to camera)* And this is why I stick to Notre Dame football.

**JOE**: *(getting animated)* This could be how we communicate with alien civilizations! Through AI-generated roasts!

**TONY**: *(to Shane)* Did you break him?

**SHANE**: *(checking phone)* No, but Notre Dame just emailed me back. They want to discuss the kegerator proposal.

**ALL THREE**: *(looking at camera)* WHAT?!

---

### **SCENE 5: THE PAYOFF** *(3:30 - 4:00)*

**MONTAGE of quick cuts:**
- Shane celebrating with a Bud Light
- Tony still critiquing AI roasts in the background
- Joe explaining roast theory to an confused intern
- All three using the app on their phones

**SHANE**: *(to camera)* So apparently this thing works for more than just roasting.

**TONY**: *(perfecting his technique)* The AI's getting better. I think it's learning from me.

**JOE**: *(philosophical)* This app might be the future of human-AI comedy collaboration.

**SHANE**: *(raising Bud Light)* Or it's just a great way to get free beer from college football teams.

**TONY**: Download RoastiFY and see what you can break... I mean, create.

**JOE**: Just don't blame us if you have an existential crisis about artificial comedy intelligence.

**SHANE**: *(final line)* And if anyone from Michigan is watching... your team sucks.
